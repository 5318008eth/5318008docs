## Accounting Guidelines

Anytime there is division in the contract, there is a risk of numerical instability from rounding errors. To minimize this risk, the following guidelines are followed:

1. The conversion rate adopted is the number of **BaseUnits (BU)** that equals **1 PublicUnit (PU)**. The inverse rate must not be usedâ€”`TOTAL_BASE_UNITS` is always the numerator and `_totalSupply` is always the denominator. 
   - For example, if you want to convert BU to PU, instead of multiplying by the inverse rate, you should divide by the normal rate.

2. **BaseUnit** balances converted into **PublicUnits** are always rounded down (truncated).

### Guarantees

- If address **'A'** transfers **x PublicUnits** to address **'B'**, **A**'s resulting external balance will be decreased by precisely **x PublicUnits**, and **B**'s external balance will be precisely increased by **x PublicUnits**.

### Caveat

We do not guarantee that the sum of all balances will equal the result of calling `totalSupply()`. This is because, for any conversion function `f()` that has non-zero rounding error, `f(x0) + f(x1) + ... + f(xn)` is not always equal to `f(x0 + x1 + ... xn)`.

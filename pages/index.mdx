# Welcome to the 5318008 Documentation
 
Wait… seriously? You’re actually looking for documents? What, you didn’t get it the first time? You know what 5318008 is, right? Just turn your screen upside down, genius. Boom. Done. That’s the whole thing.

But since you’re here, and apparently have too much time on your hands, we’ve gone ahead and written up some totally unnecessary docs for you. Maybe you’re one of those people who need to understand every little detail before buying their 37th JPEG of a dog wearing sunglasses. Go ahead, dive into the tech, read through the smart contracts functions, study the tokenomics (even though you’ll probably just FOMO in anyway).

Still not sure? Well, go read. Then buy. Then tell everyone you "did your own research" like a pro.

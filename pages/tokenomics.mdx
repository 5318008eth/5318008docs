## Tokenomics

- **Initial Distribution**:
  - **2.5%** to the developer's wallet.
  - **2.5%** for rebase rewards.
  - **25%** is allocated to the initial liquidity pool.
  - **70%** is allocated to the progressive liquidity system.
- **Progressive Liquidity System**: Tokens are released in 12 tranches at increasing multiples of the initial price. Each tranche unlocks at different multiples of the original Base Unit price in Ethereum. (e.g., 4x, 8x, 16x, etc.).
  - Tranche unlock multipliers: [4x, 8x, 16x, 32x, 64x, 128x, 256x, 512x, 1024x, 2048x, 4096x, 8192x].

  - Ethereum raised in each tranche sale is paired with a matching amount of tokens and added directly to the liquidity pool.
